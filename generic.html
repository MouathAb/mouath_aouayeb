							<p>I think that in general a computer science engineering project has 4 steps before burying it into archieves. It starts with project definition or scoping process. Then obviously the development step followed by the deploiment. Finally the endless step of test and maintenance.</p>
							<p>The software machine learning (SML) project differs from traditional computer science project in managment, engineering, and research (MER) on the 4 pre-cited steps. Managment (M) of traditional projects focus on define and organize human resources, time, and money to limit the specifications of the project and for sure "how to maximize the profit ?". The research (R) is mostly about "push it to the limit" with already pre-defined algorithms with the minimum complexity. And the engineering (E) is the core of the rest from development, deploiment, test to maintenance. In SML projects the MER is present on every step. In the scoping process you have managment skills to know the money stuff, the reseach skills to kept yourself up to date whith the new ML model performance and engineering skills to know the time and the resources that it needs. </p>
